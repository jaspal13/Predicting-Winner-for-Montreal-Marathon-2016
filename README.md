# Predicting-Winner-for-Montreal-Marathon-2016
This project was done as a part of the Applied Machine Learning Course (COMP 551) at McGill University and was done in a group of 3 students. The Montreal Oasis Marathon takes place every year in Montreal, Canada since 1979. Data representing participantâ€™s attendance and their performance at the the event from 2012 to 2015 along with the record of their performances at other similar events is available online. In hopes of predicting the attendance for the upcoming race in 2016 and their time of completion three machine learning algorithms were implemented to train models on the given data.
